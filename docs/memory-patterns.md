During review, discovered (issue :: race condition) in authentication module. 
Problem occurs with (trigger :: concurrent login attempts).

Bob :: suggested :: mutex lock implementation
decision :: add synchronization layer
follow-up :: [[procedures/implement-mutex-lock]]

## 14:00 - API Design Meeting  
participants :: [[Alice]], [[Charlie]]
project :: [[api-v2]]
type :: design discussion

Discussed (topic :: backwards compatibility) requirements. Charlie (concern :: breaking changes) 
suggested (approach :: versioned endpoints).

decision :: implement v2 with v1 compatibility
timeline :: 3 weeks
assigned to :: [[Charlie]]

## Daily Synthesis
key insight :: race conditions pattern in shared state
learning :: Bob has deep [[concurrent-programming]] expertise  
connection :: today's auth issue relates to [[incidents/2024-02-28-login-failures]]
```

### Decision Trail
```markdown
# Authentication Architecture Decision

## Context
date :: 2024-03-15
participants :: [[Alice]], [[Bob]], [[Security Team]]
problem :: frequent login timeouts

## Analysis
symptom :: 2.3 second average response time
root cause :: database connection pooling
investigated by :: [[Bob]]

## Options Considered

### Option A: Increase Pool Size
pros :: quick fix, minimal code changes  
cons :: doesn't solve core issue
estimated effort :: 1 day

### Option B: Implement Connection Caching
pros :: addresses root cause
cons :: more complex implementation
estimated effort :: 1 week

## Decision
chosen :: Option B - Connection Caching
rationale :: sustainable long-term solution
decided by :: [[Alice]]
implementation :: [[Bob]]
review date :: 2024-04-01
```

## Procedural Memory (How-To Knowledge)

### Process Documentation
```markdown
# Diagnose Race Conditions

type :: procedure
domain :: concurrent programming  
difficulty :: intermediate
last updated :: 2024-03-15
learned from :: [[journal/2024-03-15#code-review-session]]

## When to Apply

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `intermittent failures` | System works sometimes, fails others |
| `load-related issues` | Problems appear only under high traffic |
| `"works locally"` | Different behavior in dev vs production |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `[[threading-basics]]` | Understanding of concurrent execution |
| `[[debugging-tools]]` | Access to profiling and logging tools |
| `[[system-access]]` | Production environment permissions |

## Steps

### 1. Identify Shared State
action :: list all shared variables
tool :: static analysis scanner
output :: shared resource inventory

### 2. Trace Access Patterns  
action :: instrument code with thread logging
duration :: 24 hours minimum
analysis :: look for overlapping access windows

### 3. Reproduce Locally
approach :: simulate production load
tool :: load testing framework
validation :: verify race condition occurs
